##Abstract
 

Food waste is a critical global issue, with millions of tons of edible food discarded annually while food insecurity affects vulnerable populations. Traditional food donation systems lack efficiency in matching surplus food with those in need, often leading to delays, mismanagement, and spoilage. **ZeroWaste** is an **AI-powered Geo-Intelligent Food Donation & Rescue System** designed to optimize food redistribution by connecting donors (restaurants, caterers, households) with receivers (NGOs, individuals, volunteers) in real-time using location intelligence and predictive analytics.
